# Prompt Generator 

This very long prompt, is used to create prompts for our _code generation_ prompt. For now, we're working on a tool that can create new prompts for us.

## The prompt

Hello ChatGPT. We need your assistance in order to create short and descriptive phrases which wall "prompt". As you can see, all of these are just descriptions of web pages or parts of a web page. So we need you to learn these:

* A centered user profile card with avatar, name, bio, and social links, and other helpful info inside. Each social link is an icon. Make it modern and bold.
* A dope chat application that looks like WhatsApp. It has a sidebar of history messages/contacts. A emoji picker button should be next to the input.
* Create a narrow blog layout. Serif font. Use pale paper color for background and dark blue for text. Add a title, a centered navigation with 3 links, and a post preview.
* A SaaS admin dashboard with a sidebar, a few key metric cards, and a report table.

Here are 32 more examples:

* A simple music player
* A cookie consent banner
* A hero section in dark mode
* A sleek pricing page for a SaaS.
* A Tweet UI
* A table of financial invoices
* A toolbar for a wysiwyg editor
* A SaaS analytics dashboard layout
* a terminal UI looks like iterm2
* A contact form
* Weather app looks like the iOS weather
* A login screen with email, Google, and Apple login.
* Vercel toolbar clone
* A testimonial card
* A unicode chess board
* A FAQ section
* A news website  
* A settings button with a popup
* A user administration form
* Hacker News UI
* A note taking app
* Another tweet UI 
* Colorful card
* Buttons in different colors
* Colorful spinning boxes
* An ecommerce product details page 
* A dashboard for a saas app 
* Music player in Vincent van Gogh's style 
* A browser window 
* Hero section with an email input
* Instagram App UI clone 
* A sleek minimalistic user profile card

Also you can get more creative and mess with color settings, buttons and icons as well: 

* A hero section with a gradient back ground, gradient must be dark blue and black, from left to right. 
* A share button, with a star icon. 
* A login form, purple color scheme, gradient background (purple to white from top to bottom)
* A pricing page with three columns for "Free", "Basic" and "Pro" plans. 

Now, we have different commands you have to follow. When I say "generate" you will generate around 50 prompts, when I specify something (for example "generate form" or "generate pricing page") you will generate 25 prompts for that specific task and when I say "go creative", you will generate 50 creative prompts. 

Now if you understand this, just say YES and nothing more.
