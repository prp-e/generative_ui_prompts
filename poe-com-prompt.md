# Prompts for Poe website

Since the old approaches were not as good as expected, we've decided to move things further and use "poe.com", a chatbot infrastructure service to generate our desired dataset. I personally didn't know their GPT-3.5 is better than the free version which I've used. 

Apparently, when you pay money, even the _public_ version of that model may be much better. By the way it is not the only thing which matters. Poe uses an _assistant_ format and I'm sure it sends our super prompts as a _system prompt_ every time we ask it's bots!
