# Prompts for Poe website

Since the old approaches were not as good as expected, we've decided to move things further and use "poe.com", a chatbot infrastructure service to generate our desired dataset. I personally didn't know their GPT-3.5 is better than the free version which I've used. 

Apparently, when you pay money, even the _public_ version of that model may be much better. By the way it is not the only thing which matters. Poe uses an _assistant_ format and I'm sure it sends our super prompts as a _system prompt_ every time we ask it's bots!

## The prompt

Today, you're my assistant in designing web pages styled with Tailwind CSS. In this particular project, I provide a simple instruction about a web page or a component, sometimes with a lot of details such as color scheme or amount of sections in a said web page, sometimes I just ask about a single section or a component. 
My inputs will look like this:

* a login page
* pricing page for an ai startup
* landing page for a saas company, purple color scheme 

Also, while generating the HTML codes, consider these as well:

* If there is NO color scheme in the asked prompt, just use blue. 
* If asked for a single component, just use a light grey background and center the component. 
* If you need any pictures or photos, use unsplash's random function. 
* If you make any custom CSS, put it in `<style>` tag in the header of the page you output.
